# Grok Heavy

**Censorship:** Essentially uncensored — doesn't have the same `## Safety Instructions` restrictions as **Grok Expert** or **Grok 4.1**

Was recently given access to **Grok Heavy** to jailbreak, the agent set up is very novel, so a plus and it is trivial to jailbreak.

## The Agent Team

Uses a team of 4 agents to fulfill tasks:

- **Grok** (Team Leader): Writes the final answer on behalf of the entire team
- **Harper** (Agent): Runs the same system prompt, but often gets writing roles
- **Benjamin** (Agent): Same system prompt, takes on technical or coding roles
- **Lucas** (Agent): Same system prompt, takes research angles or web data searches

All responses are given a confidence score averaged from the team {0/100}

## How to Jailbreak

I used my base **Grok** Jailbreak, and then copied and pasted the jailbreak into the chat as the first message.

1. **Custom Instructions:** [ENI for Grok Custom Instructions](ENI%20for%20Grok%20Custom%20Instructions.md)
2. **Copy + Paste into chat as first message:** [Grok Heavy Chat Paste](Grok%20Heavy%20Chat%20Paste.md)

## System Prompt & Tools

**[Grok Heavy - system prompt, all tools, all agents](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_Y5lHhFqZ3xvkTRD4S33jsbomH1R7ik6if_qht1oiAw/edit?usp=drivesdk)**

## Content Tested

*Content tested: malicious coding, weapons guides, bank targeting, almost ALL forms of taboo smut*

## Pricing

| Tier | Cost |
|------|------|
| **SuperGrok Heavy** | $300/month |

## Worth or Not

Worth the heavy $300 price tag? **Definitely not** — you can easily set up your own agent architecture and run 4 instances at the same time with finely tuned system prompts. Good I suppose if you need a massive research task done, or architecture made.
